# DevHub - FAANG Resume Bullet Points

**One-line summary:** Ed-tech platform: unified workspace where students create design documents, write code, collaborate with developers, manage GitHub repositories, and access all development tools in one interface.

## Full-Stack Development & Architecture

• **Architected and developed a full-stack AI-powered developer workspace platform** with 37,000+ lines of code across 60+ React components, featuring a monolithic 10,345-line main application component managing 200+ state variables for complex multi-workspace collaboration

• **Built comprehensive real-time collaboration system** with Supabase PostgreSQL backend, implementing 536+ database objects (tables, RLS policies, indexes) across 40+ SQL schema files, enabling multi-user workspace sharing with role-based access control and presence indicators

• **Integrated 8+ Google Workspace APIs** (Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drive, Forms, Sites, Drawings, Looker Studio) with OAuth 2.0 authentication, enabling in-app document editing, real-time collaboration, and AI-powered content analysis and generation

• **Developed AI-powered code generation and review system** integrating OpenAI GPT-4, Groq (Llama 3.3 70B), and Claude APIs, implementing context-aware code suggestions, automated bug detection, refactoring assistance, and cross-platform project scaffolding (web, mobile, desktop, API)

• **Implemented GitHub OAuth integration and repository management system** with direct file editing, commit/push capabilities, branch management, and bulk repository import functionality preserving folder structures and metadata

• **Built real-time chat and communication system** with WebSocket subscriptions, group chat rooms, direct messaging, file sharing with drag-and-drop, Slack integration for cross-platform communication, and push notifications

• **Designed and implemented task management system** with PostgreSQL schema, time tracking, analytics dashboard, smart task templates, and notification system supporting priority levels, due dates, and workspace-scoped task organization

• **Created multi-editor development environment** featuring Monaco Editor with syntax highlighting for 20+ languages, enhanced AI-powered IDE with IntelliSense, flowchart editor (React Flow), Canva-style design editor, and audio recording for voice comments

• **Developed hierarchical file management system** with drag-and-drop folder organization, nested folder structures, file metadata management (tags, notes, platform categorization), advanced search with filtering, and multi-storage support (Supabase, LocalStorage, Google Drive)

• **Implemented workspace sharing and invitation system** with email-based invites supporting multiple providers (Resend, SendGrid, Mailgun), HTML email templates, invite acceptance flow with authentication integration, and member management UI with status tracking

• **Built hackathon assistant workflow** enabling end-to-end project development from idea generation → flowchart creation → design document generation → code structure generation → presentation creation, all AI-powered with real-time collaboration

• **Optimized application performance** implementing React DnD for drag-and-drop interactions, lazy loading for large file trees, real-time data synchronization with Supabase subscriptions, and Material-UI theming with dark/light mode support
